Are you still add Serial numbers/Lot numbers manually? then it is a time-consuming process. By default, In Odoo user has to add barcode of Serial numbers/Lot numbers one by one. so it is a boring process. Here we made this process automated. It helps to manage the product Serial numbers/Lot numbers in the purchase(Incoming Order) process and sale(Delivery Order) process easily, so you can easily scan the barcode of Serial numbers/Lot numbers in Picking (Shipment/Delivery). scan it and you do! So be very quick in inventory operation of odoo and cheers!
